	abstract = {We propose the lag‐1 autocorrelation of daily precipitation as a simple diagnostic of tropical precipitation variability in climate models. This metric generally has a relatively uniform distribution of positive values across the tropics. However, selected land regions are characterized by exceptionally low autocorrelation values. Low values correspond to the dominance of high frequency variance in precipitation, and specifically of high frequency convectively coupled equatorial waves. Consistent with previous work, we show that CMIP6 climate models overestimate the autocorrelation. Global kilometer‐scale models capture the observed autocorrelation when deep convection is explicitly simulated. When a deep convection parameterization is used, though, the autocorrelation increases over land and ocean, suggesting that land surface‐atmosphere interactions are not responsible for the changes in autocorrelation. Furthermore, the metric also tracks the accuracy of the representation of the relative importance of high frequency and low frequency convectively coupled equatorial waves in the models.},

	abstract = {One of the most important parameters to quantify an aerosol is the particle number concentration. Condensation particle counters (CPCs) are commonly used to measure the aerosol number concentration in the nanometer size range. To compare the data from different measurement stations and campaigns, it is important to harmonize the instrument speciﬁcations, which is why the CEN/TS 16976:2016 technical speciﬁcation was introduced for CPCs. Therein, the parameters of the CEN CPC are speciﬁed for standard pressure and temperature. However, CEN CPCs are used in various surroundings, on high mountains or on airplanes, where they are exposed to low-pressure conditions. Here, we present the pressure-dependent performance (including the concentration linearity and counting efﬁciency) of two different models of CEN CPCs, the Grimm 5410 CEN and the TSI 3772 CEN. We found that their performance at 1000 and 750 hPa was in accordance with the CEN technical speciﬁcations. Below 500 hPa, the performance decreased for both CPC models, but the decrease was different for the two models. To gain insight into the performance of the two CPC models, we performed a simulation study. This study included simulations of the saturation proﬁles and calculations of internal particle losses within the CPCs. The simulations reproduced the overall performance decrease with decreasing pressure and reveal that the internal structure of the CPC has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the performance. We anticipate our publication to provide a deeper understanding of the counting efﬁciency of CPCs and their pressure dependence. Our ﬁndings might be a starting point for new standards that include the pressure-dependent performance, or they could help in designing new CPCs.},
