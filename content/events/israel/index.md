In autumn 2023 I joined <a href="https://www.oriadam.info/"> Ori Adam's research group </a> at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem after receiving a mobility fellowship from the University of Vienna. 
Ori is an expert in tropical dynamics, and we'd planned to work on the atmospheric energy budget over the West African monsoon region and its representation in km-scale climate models.
Tragically, the war started on 7 October and I had to leave the country early. Nevertheless, I learned a lot during my time in Israel and I am grateful to have had this opportunity.
