I successfully defended my PhD thesis in September 2025. The defense committee consisted of Caroline Muller from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and Wouter Dorigo from the Technical University of Vienna. While my thesis covers rainfall in the tropics more generally, I focused on the Sahel region in my defense talk, covering observations and climate model simulations. Afterwards, I had to complete some fun games, such as the one whose instructions are visible in the above picture, before receiving my PhD hat. It was a nice way to end my time at the University of Vienna.
