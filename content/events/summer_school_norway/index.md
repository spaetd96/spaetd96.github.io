In the summer of 2022, I attended the CHESS Summer School on Land-Atmosphere Interaction Processes and Convection in Norway. 
As part of the school, we listened to lectures covering a wide range of topics from experimental meteorology to model parameterization.
We were also able to experience convection first hand during glider flights.
