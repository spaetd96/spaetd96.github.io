Together with my PhD student colleague Johannes Voigt, I attended the renowned Earth System Modeling School at MPI-M Hamburg.
The participants were divided into small groups. Each group simulated and analyzed the Earth system under extremely modified conditions. 
For example, my group simulated an atmosphere where clouds were transparent to radiation. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of climate modeling and the climate system as a whole.
