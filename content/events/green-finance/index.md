At the beginning of the winter semester 2024/2025 I gave a guest lecture in the course ['green finance'](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=030513&semester=2024W)
at the Faculty of Law of the University of Vienna. The course covers topics like the EU taxonomy and greenwashing. I provided the students with basic knowledge about the 
fundamentals of global warming in a 45-minute talk, followed by a lively discussion.
