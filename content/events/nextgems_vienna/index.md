In the early summer of 2022, I participated in the cycle 2 [nextGEMS](https://nextgems-h2020.eu/) hackathon, which was hosted by my PhD advisor Aiko Voigt at the University of Vienna.
I was part of the 'Storms and Ocean' group and investigated the representation of monsoon precipitation in the two kilometer-scale models in comparison to observation data.
The large output data of the simulations also triggered my continued interest in how to efficiently handle big data using Python on HPC systems. 
The hackathon was a very valuable experience for me and paved the way for the first paper of my PhD.
