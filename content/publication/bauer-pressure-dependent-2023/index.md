abstract: One of the most important parameters to quantify an aerosol is the particle
  number concentration. Condensation particle counters (CPCs) are commonly used to
  measure the aerosol number concentration in the nanometer size range. To compare
  the data from different measurement stations and campaigns, it is important to harmonize
  the instrument speciﬁcations, which is why the CEN/TS 16976:2016 technical speciﬁcation
  was introduced for CPCs. Therein, the parameters of the CEN CPC are speciﬁed for
  standard pressure and temperature. However, CEN CPCs are used in various surroundings,
  on high mountains or on airplanes, where they are exposed to low-pressure conditions.
  Here, we present the pressure-dependent performance (including the concentration
  linearity and counting efﬁciency) of two different models of CEN CPCs, the Grimm
  5410 CEN and the TSI 3772 CEN. We found that their performance at 1000 and 750 hPa
  was in accordance with the CEN technical speciﬁcations. Below 500 hPa, the performance
  decreased for both CPC models, but the decrease was different for the two models.
  To gain insight into the performance of the two CPC models, we performed a simulation
  study. This study included simulations of the saturation proﬁles and calculations
  of internal particle losses within the CPCs. The simulations reproduced the overall
  performance decrease with decreasing pressure and reveal that the internal structure
  of the CPC has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the performance. We anticipate our publication
  to provide a deeper understanding of the counting efﬁciency of CPCs and their pressure
  dependence. Our ﬁndings might be a starting point for new standards that include
  the pressure-dependent performance, or they could help in designing new CPCs.
